        Fits the logistic regression model to the data using gradient descent.

        This method initializes the model's weights and bias, then iteratively updates these parameters by
        moving in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function (computed using the
        log_likelihood method).

        The regularization terms are added to the gradient of the loss function as follows:

        - No regularization: The standard gradient descent updates are applied without any modification.

        - L1 (Lasso) regularization: Adds a term to the gradient that penalizes the absolute value of
            the weights, encouraging sparsity. The update rule for weight w_j is adjusted as follows:
            dw_j += (C / m) * sign(w_j) - Make sure you understand this!

        - L2 (Ridge) regularization: Adds a term to the gradient that penalizes the square of the weights,
            discouraging large weights. The update rule for weight w_j is:
            dw_j += (C / m) * w_j       - Make sure you understand this!


        - ElasticNet regularization: Combines L1 and L2 penalties.
            The update rule incorporates both the sign and the magnitude of the weights:
            dw_j += l1_ratio * gradient_of_lasso + (1 - l1_ratio) * gradient_of_ridge


        Parameters:
        - X (np.ndarray): The input features, with shape (m, n), where m is the number of examples and n is
                            the number of features.
        - y (np.ndarray): The true labels of the data, with shape (m,).
        - learning_rate (float): The step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of the
                            loss function.
        - num_iterations (int): The number of iterations for which the optimization algorithm should run.
        - penalty (str): Type of regularization (None, 'lasso', 'ridge', 'elasticnet'). Default is None.
        - l1_ratio (float): The Elastic Net mixing parameter, with 0 <= l1_ratio <= 1.
                            l1_ratio=0 corresponds to L2 penalty,
                            l1_ratio=1 to L1. Only used if penalty='elasticnet'.
                            Default is 0.5.
        - C (float): Inverse of regularization strength; must be a positive float.
                            Smaller values specify stronger regularization.
        - verbose (bool): Print loss every print_every iterations.
